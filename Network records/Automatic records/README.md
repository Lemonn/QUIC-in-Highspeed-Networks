# Automatic records

This records have been created by an automated script to test the same situation many times. This was necessary, to be sure that particular behavior does not occur only once. So the results overall are more reliable than a single measurement would be.

Each situation has been recorded ten times and saved in folders named after the number of the measurement. Some logs contain more than ten files, that indicates that a certain part of a recording is missing. To compensate this, an additional record has been made, so for each situation there at least 10 correct logs.


Each situation has been recorded ten times and sored in folders named after the number of the measurement. Some logs contain more than ten files, that indicates that a certain part of a recording is missing. To compensate this, an additional record has been made, so for each situation there at least 10 correct logs. Non correct logs could be identified by the number of files in the folder, because there less files. There kept anyway because the still captured data is not false.

The Data Could be visualized like described here: Visualization of the Log-files
